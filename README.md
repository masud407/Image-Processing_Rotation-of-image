# Image-Processing_Rotation-of-image
The project involves the process to rotate an image following the steps below:

Your script must follow these restrictions and specifications:
1. It may only use Matlabâ€™s image I/O (e.g., imread), display (e.g., imshow) and imrotate ()
functions. Use of other Matlab functions may be allowed after a case-by-case
consideration.
2. Except for I/O filenames, it may not ask for any user input.
3. It must display the input and output pairs as shown in the example below.
4. It must successfully process the three test images that are provided. Processing other test
images is highly recommended.
